### Hi there 👋🏼

I am **Alina**, a student at HackYourFuture Denmark and a software developer intern at PeekEmbrace.

✨ My passion is front-end development together with UX UI. Basically I just love making web-apps beautiful and user-friendly.

📚 Currently I am studying TypeScript.

### My skills for now include:<br>
✅ HTML/CSS/Sass <br>
✅ Responsive Design <br>
✅ Git <br>
✅ JavaScript | TypeScript <br>
✅ React <br>
✅ Node.js <br>
✅ MySQL <br>
✅ Python for data analysis <br>
✅ Adobe XD <br>
✅ Figma <br>
✅ Prototyping <br>

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on front-end projects for either web or mobile. Looking forward to applying my skills on real projects!
